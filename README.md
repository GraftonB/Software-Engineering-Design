## Enhancement One: Software Engineering and Design ##

### Artifact Description ###

The chosen artifact for Milestone 2 is the Weight Loss app designed for CS-360, developed last term over the course of 8 weeks, from March to June 2023. It is an Android mobile application written in Java. The app includes features such as weight logging, goal setting, account creation, and an account management system.

### Justification for Inclusion ###

I have selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it showcases my skills and abilities in software development, particularly in the areas of software engineering and design. The app's functionality and design demonstrate my capability to create a fully functional mobile application with multiple features, ensuring a seamless user experience.

The enhancements made to this artifact involved improvements in software design and engineering across various aspects of the app. I focused on refining the weight tracking system, eliminating redundancies, and adding new functionalities like the ability to edit, delete, and add entries.

### Reflection on the Enhancement Process ###

Throughout the enhancement process, I encountered several challenges, mainly due to the initial code's lack of modularity, maintainability, and comprehensibility. The code lacked proper commenting, making it difficult to understand, especially when dealing with more complex components. As a result, I learned the importance of writing clean, modular, and well-documented code that establishes a strong foundation for future maintenance and feature additions.

Another benefit was this enhancement process exposed me to various libraries, methods, patterns, and data structures that I was not familiar with previously. Utilizing an approach of iterative development allowed me to explore better ways to implement specific components and expand my knowledge in software development.

### Feedback Incorporation and Artifact Improvement ###

The artifact was significantly improved by addressing specific issues identified in the original version of the Weight Loss app. The weight-logging screen was non-functional and limited to 5 maximum entries, which was resolved by implementing a linear layout that dynamically generates a new row whenever the user logs a new weight. The addition of "Edit" and "Delete" buttons enabled users to modify or remove previously logged entries, enhancing both functionality and user experience.

Redundancies were also eliminated throughout the app, simplifying its appearance and improving user experience. This involved removing duplicate sections related to defining a goal weight, as well as enhancing screen navigation. Previously, users were unable to navigate between specific screens, but with the implemented changes, all screens accessible to the user can now be freely navigated in any order once logged in.

The application was also refactored and optimized to better adhere to coding conventions. Variables were renamed for readability, imports were optimized, Java files were refactored to allow for more modular code, again lending to further maintanability down the road.
### Alignment with Course Objectives ###

The enhancements made to the Weight Loss app align with my initial course objective goal, which was to "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals." The improvements exemplify my ability to employ well-thought-out development practices to implement solutions that deliver value and adhere to coding conventions.

In conclusion, the process of enhancing the Weight Loss app allowed me to enhance its usability, functionality, and user experience while also achieving the desired course outcome. The challenges I faced and the feedback I incorporated served as valuable lessons in writing efficient and maintainable code, the enhancements represent my understandings and improvements within the category of Software Design and Engineering.
